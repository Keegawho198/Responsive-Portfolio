<p>Hello My name is Keegan, the picture is me with Shrek. I was born in South Africa
  and grew up in New Zealand until I was 17 were I then moved to Melbourne, Australia.
 My favourite shows are Doctor who, Game of thrones (before season 8) and the walking dead.
  I love watching movies. My favourite sport is Basketball. </p>

<p>I am studung at monash, doing a programming bootcamp in hopes that it will
  enhance my knowledge when it comes to programming and better prepare me 
to attatin a job in the IT field. In most of my spare time, I like to play video games on my playstation 4 or watch stuff on neflix.
  depending on my mood, I might go out and order my favourite food, Macdonalds otherwise
  I will cook something myself. I usually make pasta or eggs, they are the easy to cook.
  Other than that, I also like the color yellow. I like all kinds of music. From Rap to rock, even K-pop
  but now and then I like listening to themes songs from movies.
</p>

<p>
 I love to code and create new things. I am also hoping to get a job in programming
 as I believe that it will be fun and satisfying work. I also like the famous saying, said by Walt Disney, "Keep 
 moving forward". Or something like that. No point dwelling on the past. It's better to work on what you have now
 and in the future.
