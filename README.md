Responsive Portfolio for homework

this is a responsive portfolio page, that should be able to ajust its size when the screen is made smaller and images and certain texts and headers should ajust appropriately.

If you change the screen width to less than 500px than you will be able to see the changes.

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.

also having a small problem with the logo. cant get it to align with the content the way i would like but other than that everything seems to be working fine.
